# Project Title

Data processing system in fog-based architecture

## Target

Collect data (by using M5Stack microcontroller)
Design the database structure
Develop algorithms for processing data


### Applied technologies studying

MQTT protocol
```
http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/mqtt/
```
Timeseries data
```
https://docs.timescale.com/latest/main
```
Docker
```
